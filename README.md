# Moveyes: A Journey in Flutter Development

Building Moveyes has been a transformative experience in mobile development, particularly in mastering Flutter's ecosystem and creating seamless user experiences. The project presented unique challenges that helped me grow as a developer.

The most significant challenge was implementing clean architecture within Flutter. Using the Provider pattern for state management proved crucial, especially when handling complex states across multiple screens. The movie player screen, for instance, required careful management of watch progress updates while maintaining a responsive UI.

Integrating with Express.js backend was particularly challenging. I learned to create robust service classes in Flutter that handle API communication, token management, and error states gracefully:

Working with Flutter's widget lifecycle proved enlightening, especially when implementing features like background progress tracking and state persistence. The watch history feature required careful consideration of data synchronization and offline capabilities.

### Key Learnings
- Implementing clean architecture in Flutter
- Managing complex state with Provider
- Handling API communication gracefully
- Creating responsive and animated UIs
- Building secure authentication flows

The project taught me the importance of error handling and user feedback. Every network call, state change, and user interaction needed proper error boundaries and loading states, ensuring a smooth user experience even under poor network conditions.

Through Moveyes, I've grown from understanding basic Flutter concepts to implementing complex features while maintaining clean, maintainable code. The experience has strengthened my foundation in mobile development, particularly in creating robust Flutter applications.
